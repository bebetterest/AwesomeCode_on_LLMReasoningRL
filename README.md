TinyZero is a reproduction of DeepSeek R1 Zero in countdown and multiplication tasks.
built upon veRL.

- [simpleRL-reason](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/simpleRL-reason)

simpleRL-reason reproduces the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 for complex mathematical reasoning, starting from Qwen-2.5-Math-7B (base model), and only using 8K (query, final answer) examples from the original MATH dataset.
built upon OpenRLHF.
